# AnalyzeDataSet Part 2

This dataset comprises of multiple signals from isolated pure cells, mixed cells(type 1) and mixed cells (type2). The goal of this task is to evaluate both data sets and infer relationships between the two datasets i.e. Use the data from the isolated pure cells can you predict how many of each cell type are present in the mixed cell population.

#Tasks
* Look at the isolated pure cell and suggest a data cleaning procedure or approach to create a training data set
* Identify or propose a method to create the training model set i.e. What methods would you use and why? 
* Create a training model 
* Use these training models to predict the total counts of the individual cell types in mixed cells-type 1 and mixed cells- type 2
