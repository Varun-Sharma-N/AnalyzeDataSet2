# AnalyzeDataSet Part 2

This dataset comprises of multiple signals from isolated pure cells, mixed cells(type 1) and mixed cells (type2). The goal of this task is to evaluate both data sets and infer relationships between the two datasets i.e. Use the data from the isolated pure cells can you predict how many of each cell type are present in the mixed cell population.

## Tasks
### Data Preparation and cleaning
* Look at the known cells measurement and suggest a data cleaning procedure or approach to create a training data set
* This can include removing duplicates, correcting errors, dealing with missing values, normalization, data types conversions etc.
* Split this data set into training and evaluation data sets

### Create a training model
* Identify or propose a method to create the training model set i.e. What methods would you use and why? 
* Next implement it. Yes, go ahead and create a training model 
* Evaluate your model - what metrics would you use to quantitatively measure the performance of your model

### Predict
* Use these training models to predict the total counts of the individual cell types in mixed cells-type 1 and mixed cells- type 2


## Dataset
A link to the dataset will be sent to you 

## Submission
* Create a branch with your submission
* Create a pull request
* Submit a 2 page summary by email regarding your choices and summary of results by email. 


## Do's
* Include visualizations and share insights
* Reach out to us with questions
* Reach out to the team if you have issues accessing the data
* Use Python - WE LOVE PYTHON, R works as well
* If you exceed the timelines, do propose and describe in your summary your approach

## Do not 
* Spend more than 2 hrs working on this - code
* Spend more that 30 mins documenting your work i.e code and summary
